    "text": "2.2 Spyder\nTo create Python code and scripts, we will be using the Spyder application, which you can open by clicking on Launch in the Anaconda Navigator or by searching for the Spyder application on your computer directly. We note that there are many other applications that you can use to create Python code with (such as Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook; two other applications also installed in the Anaconda distribution).\nOnce you have opened Spyder, you should see an application that looks like this:\n\n\n\nSpyder\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Python Console\nIn the bottom right pane you see a console with IPython. IPython is short for Interactive Python. We can type Python commands into this console and see the output directly. To find 1+1 in Python, we can use the command 1+1, similar to how we would do it in Excel or in the Google search engine. Let’s try this out in the console. First, click on the console to move the cursor there. Then type 1+1 and press Enter. We will see the output 2 on the next line next to a red Out [1]:\n\n\n\nIPython Console\n\n\nThe red Out [1] means this is the output from the first line of input (after the green In [1]). The second command will have input In [2] and output Out [2].\n\n\n2.2.2 Python Scripts\nTyping commands directly into the IPython console is fine if all you want to do is try out a few different simple commands (like we do at the start of the next chapter). However, when working on a project you will often be executing many commands. If you were to do all of this in the interactive console it would be very easy to lose track of what you are doing. It would also be very easy to make mistakes.\nWriting your commands in Python scripts is a solution to this problem. A Python script is a text file with a .py extension where you can write all of your commands in the order you want them run. You can then get Spyder to run the entire file of commands (or only a part of them).\n\nIn Spyder, in the left pane you see a file open called temp.py when you start up Spyder. This is an example Python script. We can ignore what is written in the first 6 lines of the script. In fact, you can remove these lines if you want. We can add our 1 + 1 command to the bottom of the script like this and save it:\n\n\n\nPython Script\n\n\nIn the Toolbar there are several ways to run this command from the script. For example, you can run the entire file, or run only the current line or selected area. If the cursor is on the line with 1 + 1 and we press the “Run selection or current line” button, then we will see the command and output appear in the IPython console, just like how we typed it there before. Using the script, however, we have saved and documented our work.\nIf you try run the entire file, you will see runfile('...') in the IPython console with the ... being the path to the Python script you are running. However, you don’t see a 2 in the output. This is because when running an entire file, Python does not show the output of each line being run. To see the output of any command we need to put it inside the print() function. We can change our line to print(1 + 1) to see the output when running the entire file:\n\n\n\nUsing the print() function\n\n\nWhen you run the entire file you should now see a 2 below the runfile('...') command. We now know how to write and run Python scripts! In the next chapter we will learn more Python commands.\n\n\n2.2.3 Code snippets in this online book\nIn this book, we won’t always show screenshots like we did above. Instead we will show code snippets in boxes like this:\n\n1 + 1\n\n2\n\n\n The top part is code and the bottom part in gray is the output of the executed code. There is a small clipboard icon on the right which you can use to copy the code to paste into your own Python file to be able to experiment with it yourself.",

    "text": "2.3 Gurobi installation\nBased on the above Anaconda installation, we will next explain how to install Gurobi, which is a software package that can solve (linear) optimization problems via Python. We assume in the below that you already have Anaconda/Python installed on your system as in the above steps.\nIf you get stuck anywhere in the installation process, then you can find more information on Gurobi’s Quick Start Guide.\n\n2.3.1 Register at Gurobi\nVisit the Gurobi website and click on the register button. Open the registration form and make sure that you select the Academic account type, and select Student for the academic position. Register with your TIAS e-mail account.\n\n\n2.3.2 Download Gurobi\nDownload Gurobi from the website. Note that you need to login with your Gurobi account before you can download Gurobi. Select the distribution that corresponds to your system (e.g., Windows or macOS), and select the regular “Gurobi Optimizer”, not any of the AMPL variations. Unless mentioned otherwise, download the most recent version.\n\n\n2.3.3 Install Gurobi\nRun the installer and follow the installation steps. At some point, the installer may ask whether to add Gurobi to your execution path. This is probably useful to accept.\n\n\n2.3.4 Gurobi license\nYou cannot use Gurobi without a license, so you need to apply for a license. As a student you can request a free academic license; take the Named-User Academic one. After you have obtained the license, you need to activate it for your Gurobi installation. If you open the license details on the Gurobi website, you can see what you need to do: open a Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS) and run the grbgetkey command with the code that corresponds to your license. This command will create your license file. Make sure that you remember where the license file is saved. The default location suggested by your device is probably the best choice.\nNote that the grbgetkey command will check that you are on an academic domain, so you need to perform this step on the university network (possibly via a VPN connection). Once installed correctly, you can also run Gurobi without an active VPN connection.\n\n\n2.3.5 Using Gurobi in Python\nGurobi should now be correctly installed, but we also want to be able to use it from Python. Therefore, we need to install Gurobi’s Python package. Open the Anaconda prompt application (can also be found in the Anaconda Navigator) and run the following commands one by one (first line + Enter, second line + Enter).\n\nconda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/gurobi\nconda install gurobi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe Anaconda prompt application is NOT the same as the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS)\n\n\nIf you don’t have the Anaconda installation, then you can do something similar with the pip command, most likely, for those familiar with it.\n\n\n2.3.6 Test your installation\nNow you can test whether everything is setup correctly. Open an interactive Python session, for instance using Spyder. Try the following commands by adding them into a script (make sure there are no spaces at the beginning of the lines) and press Enter.\n\nfrom gurobipy import Model\nmodel = Model()\n\nSet parameter Username\nSet parameter LicenseID to value 2715549\nAcademic license - for non-commercial use only - expires 2026-09-29\n\n\nIf both these commands succeed, you should see some output related to your academic license.\nIf the first command fails, then the Gurobi python module has not been installed correctly. If the second command fails, then the license has not been setup correctly (make sure the license file is at the right location).\nIf at any point, you need more information about Gurobi, then you can always go to the official Gurobi documention online or send the teacher an e-mail.",

We put the name we want to give to the variable on the left, then use the = symbol as the assignment operator, and put the number to the right of the =. The = operator binds a number (on the right-hand size of =) to a name (on the left-hand side of =).\nTo see this at work, let’s set x=2 and y=3 and calculate x+y:\n\nx = 2\ny = 3\nprint(x + y)\n\n5\n\n\nWhen we assign x=2, in our code, the number is not fixed forever. We can assign a new number to x. For example, we can assign the number 6 to x instead. The sum of x (which is 6) and y ( which is 3), is now 9:\n\n# Original variable assignment\nx = 2\ny = 3\nprint(x + y)\n\n# Overwriting assignment of variable x\nx = 6\nprint(x + y)\n\n5\n9\n\n\nFinally, you cannot set x=2 with the command 2 = x. That will result in an error. The name must be on the left of = and the number must be on the right of =.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExercise 3.2\n\n\n\nDefine variables a,b,c with numbers 19, 3 and 7, respectively.

Suppose we want to print all the days of the week from the days list.\nWe can do this by using a print statement for every day separately by indexing days at all its positions.\n\ndays = [\"Monday\",\"Tuesday\",\"Wednesday\",\"Thursday\",\"Friday\",\"Saturday\",\"Sunday\"]\n\nprint(\"The days of the week are:\")\nprint(days[0])\nprint(days[1])\nprint(days[2])\nprint(days[3])\nprint(days[4])\nprint(days[5])\nprint(days[6])\n\nThe days of the week are:\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\nSaturday\nSunday\n\n\nHowever, looking at the above, the only thing that changes in the last seven lines of code is the position at which we access days. We can also print all the days of the week based on the list days above using a for-loop.\n\ndays = [\"Monday\",\"Tuesday\",\"Wednesday\",\"Thursday\",\"Friday\",\"Saturday\",\"Sunday\"]\n\nfor i in range(0,7):\n    print(days[i])\n\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\nSaturday\nSunday\n\n\nWith the line for i in range(0,7): we tell Python that we would like to carry out a piece of code (the line below it) with different values of the iteration variable i ranging from 0 to 7, but NOT including 7. In other words, we want to run a piece of code for the values of i being 0,1,2,3,4,5 and 6. It is important to realize here that the index 7 is not included as value for i in the for-loop (this is what the Python developers decided on).\nIn Python such a range, called the iterable, can be specified with the range(a,b) function where a is the smallest value and b-1 the largest value of i. In the first iteration with i = 0 Python will now print days[0], in the second iteration with i = 1 Python will print days[1], etcetera.\nThe code we want to execute repeatedly can be found under the lines for i in range(0,7): with an indentation (or tab). The indendation is important so that Python known this is the line of code you want to be carried out repeatedly. We can also carry out multiple lines of code in a for-loop, then all these lines should be indented.\n\ndays = [\"Monday\",\"Tuesday\",\"Wednesday\",\"Thursday\",\"Friday\",\"Saturday\",\"Sunday\"]\n\nfor i in range(0,7):\n    print(\"Day\", i+1, \"of the week is:\")\n    print(days[i])\n\nDay 1 of the week is:\nMonday\nDay 2 of the week is:\nTuesday\nDay 3 of the week is:\nWednesday\nDay 4 of the week is:\nThursday\nDay 5 of the week is:\nFriday\nDay 6 of the week is:\nSaturday\nDay 7 of the week is:\nSunday\n\n\nNote that in the first line in the for-loop, here we print three aspects in one print() statement: The word Day, the value of i+1, and the words of the week is:. As i ranges from 0 to 6, the values of i+1 ranges from 1 to 7.\nWe note that we only use two print statements for the sake of illustration. The above could have been printed with one print() statement as well.\n\ndays = [\"Monday\",\"Tuesday\",\"Wednesday\",\"Thursday\",\"Friday\",\"Saturday\",\"Sunday\"]\n\nfor i in range(0,7):\n    print(\"Day\", i+1, \"of the week is:\", days[i])\n\nDay 1 of the week is: Monday\nDay 2 of the week is: Tuesday\nDay 3 of the week is: Wednesday\nDay 4 of the week is: Thursday\nDay 5 of the week is: Friday\nDay 6 of the week is: Saturday\nDay 7 of the week is: Sunday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExercise 3.5\n\n\n\nTake your list courses from the previous exercise and consider the list days from above. Print the five sentences: “On Monday the course [course0] is being taught”, “On Tuesday the course [course1] is being taught”, etc. by using a for-loop in which you index the courses and days from the two lists, and where [course0], [course1], etc. are the first, second, etc. course names from the list.\n\n\nWe remark that it is also possible to directly iterate over the values in a list (the iterable).\n\ndays = [\"Monday\",\"Tuesday\",\"Wednesday\",\"Thursday\",\"Friday\",\"Saturday\",\"Sunday\"]\n\nfor i in days:\n    print(i)\n\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\nSaturday\nSunday\n\n\nIn this case, i does not range from 0 to 6, but in iterates directly over the strings in the list days. So in the first iteration i = “Monday”, in the second iteration i = “Tuesday”, etcetera.",

    "section": "3.6 Conditional statements",
    "text": "3.6 Conditional statements\nIt is also possible in Python have different lines of code executed based on conditions. For this we use an if/else statement. This allows the program to execute certain lines of code only when a condition is true.\nFor example, suppose we store a number in the variable x and want to print a message only if x is greater than 5.\n\nx = 8\n\nif x &gt; 5:\n    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n\nx is greater than 5\n\n\nThe line if x &gt; 5: checks whether the condition x &gt; 5 is true. If it is true, Python executes the indented line below it. If the condition is false, nothing happens and Python continues with the rest of the code. You can check this yourself by changing the value of x to something strictly smaller than 5. If you run the code snippet, nothing should be printed.\nWe can also tell Python what to do if the condition is false by adding an else statement.\n\nx = 3\n\nif x &gt; 5:\n    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is not greater than 5\")\n\nx is not greater than 5\n\n\nHere Python checks the condition. Since 3 &gt; 5 is false, i.e., the condition x &gt; 5 is not true, the code under else: is executed instead.\nJust like with for-loops, indentation is important. All lines that belong to the if or else block must be indented so Python knows which code belongs to which condition.\nWe can also check more than two conditions using elif (short for “else if”):\n\nx = 5\n\nif x &gt; 5:\n    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\nelif x == 5:\n    print(\"x is exactly 5\")\n    print(\"You can execute multiple lines of code when a condition is true\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is less than 5\")\n\nx is exactly 5\nYou can execute multiple lines of code when a condition is true\n\n\nIn this case Python checks the conditions from top to bottom and executes only the first one that is true. In the snippet above the line \"x is exactly 5\" will be printed. You can play around with this code snippet by changing the values of x and observing that, depending on its value, a different line will be printed.\nYou can use the following symbols to compare a variable with a given number.\n\n\n\nOperator\nMeaning\nExample (x = 5)\nResult\n\n\n\n\n&lt;\nLess than\nx &lt; 7\nTrue\n\n\n&gt;\nGreater than\nx &gt; 7\nFalse\n\n\n&lt;=\nLess than or equal to\nx &lt;= 5\nTrue\n\n\n&gt;=\nGreater than or equal to\nx &gt;= 6\nFalse\n\n\n==\nEqual to\nx == 5\nTrue\n\n\n!=\nNot equal to\nx != 5\nFalse\n\n\n\nYou can also combine multiple statements into one condition using the and and or keyword arguments. In the code below, we do not finish with an else statement; this is not mandatory.\n\nx = 5\n\nif x &gt; 5 and x &lt; 10:\n    print(\"x is between 5 and 10\")\nelif x == 5 or x == -5:\n    print(\"The absolute value of x is 5\")\n\nThe absolute value of x is 5\n\n\nYou can also combine for-loops and if/else statements. For example, recall the original if/else statement where we checked whether x was greater or equal than 5.\n\nx = 3\n\nif x &gt; 5:\n    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is not greater than 5\")\n\nx is not greater than 5\n\n\nWe can also check this for a collection of numbers stored in a list numbers by iterating with a for-loop over these numbers and check the conditions for every element in the list.\n\nnumbers = [3, 7, -3, 4, 10]\n\nfor x in numbers:\n    if x &gt; 5:\n        print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n    else:\n        print(\"x is not greater than 5\")\n\nx is not greater than 5\nx is greater than 5\nx is not greater than 5\nx is not greater than 5\nx is greater than 5\n\n\nNote that in the above code we use indentation twice! For every iteration of the for-loop we want to check the if/else statement, so all those lines need to be indented. Because it also needs to be clear, for every iteration, which lines correspond to the if-statement, and which to the else-statement, the print() statements are indented once more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExercise 3.6\n\n\n\nConsider the list of temparatures (in degrees Celsius) [20, 14, 12, 18, 25, 30, 31] corresponding to the days of the week Monday through Sunday. For every day you have to print the message “[day] is a [cold/normal/hot] summer day”, where a day is cold if the temperature is below 15, normal if it is in the interval [15,25] (i.e., greater or equal than 15 and smaller or equal than 25, and hot if it is higher than 25.\nThe output of your code should be:\n\n\nMonday is a normal summer day.\nTuesday is a cold day.\nWednesday is a cold day.\nThursday is a normal summer day.\nFriday is a normal summer day.\nSaturday is a hot summer day.\nSunday is a hot summer day.",
