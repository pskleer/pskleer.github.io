    "text": "1.1 What is a programming language?\nWithout getting into a complicated details, a programming language is a way to communicate to a computer via written text in a way that the computer can understand you so that you can instruct it to do various operations. This is very different to how we often usually interact with a computer, which often involves pointing and clicking on different buttons and menus with your mouse.\nKnowing how to program is a very useful skill because you can automate repetitive tasks that would otherwise take you a very long time if you had to them “by hand” (i.e. by clicking things with your mouse). For example, suppose you work in a hotel in a city and you need to check how much your competitors are charging for rooms on different days so that you can adjust prices to stay competitive. Every day you have to go to all the different websites of the competing hotels and take note of the prices in an Excel sheet. With programming, what you could do instead is write code that tells the computer to automatically visit those websites every day, record the hotel room prices, and put them into a dataset for you. This is a process called web scraping and can be done with Python. This is just one example of the many ways programming languages can automate repetitive tasks.\nWhen humans speak to each other and someone makes a grammar mistake, it usually isn’t a big deal. We usually know what they mean. But if you make a “syntax error”, i.e, grammar mistake in a programming language, it won’t understand what you mean. The computer will throw an error. What is worse still is a “semantic error” which is when the computer runs your code without an error but does something you didn’t want it to do. Therefore we need to be very careful when writing in a programming language.",

    "text": "1.2 Why Python?\nThere are many different programming languages out there: C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, R, Julia, Stata, MATLAB, Fortran, Ruby, Perl, Rust, Go, Lua, Swift - the list goes on. So why should we learn Python over these other alternatives?\nThe best programming language depends on the task you want to accomplish. Are you building a website, writing computer software, creating a game, or analyzing data? While many languages could perform all of these tasks, some languages excel in some of them. In this course our goal is to learn basic programming techniques required for data science, and Python is by far the most popular programming language for this task. But it’s not only useful for that. It is also often used in web development, creating desktop applications and games, and for scientific computations. It is therefore a very versatile programming language that can complete a very wide range of tasks.\nPython is also completely free and open source and can run on all common operating systems. This means you can share your code with anyone and they will be able to run it, no matter what computer they are on or where they are in the world.\nThere is also a very large active community that creates packages to do a wide-range of operations, keeping Python up to date with the latest developments. For example, excellent community help is available at Stackoverflow, so if you Google how to do something in Python most likely that question has already been answered on Stackoverflow. Funnily enough, a key skill to develop with programming is how to formulate your question into Google to land on the right Stackoverflow page. More recently, “large-language” models like ChatGPT have become a very useful resource for Python. ChatGPT can write excellent Python code and also explains all the steps it takes, so we encourage you to use it as a tool to help you when you are stuck. You should keep in mind though that throughout the bachelor program, you will not always be allowed to use tools like ChatGPT.\nThese days employers are increasingly looking to hire people with programming skills. Knowing how to program in Python - one of the most commonly used languages by companies - is therefore a very valuable addition to your CV.",

We put the name we want to give to the variable on the left, then use the = symbol as the assignment operator, and put the number to the right of the =. The = operator binds a number (on the right-hand size of =) to a name (on the left-hand side of =).\nTo see this at work, let’s set x=2 and y=3 and calculate x+y:\n\nx = 2\ny = 3\nx + y\n\n5\n\n\nWhen we assign x=2, in our code, the number is not fixed forever. We can assign a new number to x. For example, we can assign the number 6 to x instead. The sum of x, which is 6, and y, which is 3 is now 9:\n\nx = 6\nx + y\n\n9\n\n\nFinally, you cannot set x=2 with the command 2 = x. That will result in an error.

We could do this manually by indexing every number and adding them one by one.\n\na = [1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 3, 7]\n\na[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] + a[4] + a[5] + a[6]\n\n28\n\n\n In fact, we can also define a new variable to store this number in. Let us call this variable total_sum.\n\na = [1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 3, 7]\n\ntotal_sum = a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] + a[4] + a[5] + a[6]\ntotal_sum\n\n28\n\n\n If the list is a is very long, for example containing thousands of elements, then it becomes very tedious to compute the total sum with the approach above. Such long lists are not uncommon in real-life data.\nA much better way is to use a for-loop, which lets us go through each element in the list one at a time. Here’s how we could compute the sum of the numbers in the list a using a for-loop:\n\na = [1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 3, 7]\ntotal_sum = 0\n\nfor i in [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]:\n    total_sum = total_sum + a[i]\n\ntotal_sum\n\n28\n\n\nLet’s break down what is happening here:\n\nWe first define the list a = [1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 3, 7]. The goal is to add up the numbers in this list.\nWe define the variable total_sum with initial value 0. This variable will be the “running total” of the numbers in a that we are adding up. After the full code has been executed, this variable will contain the sum of all numbers in a.\nWe next start the for-loop. We tell Python to repeatedly carry out the indented line of code (total_sum = total_sum + a[i]) for the index values of i in the list [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], in the order given as in the list. This list contains the indices of all the positions of the list a, which are not to be confused with the numbers a[i] at those positions.\nWhat happens in the indented line of code is that we overwrite the value of total_sum with its current value plus the number at position i in a, i.e., the number a[i]. In the table below this process is illustrated for all the values of i.\n\n\n\n\ni\na[i]\ntotal_sum after this iteration\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n0 + 1 = 1\n\n\n1\n4\n1 + 4 = 5\n\n\n2\n2\n5 + 2 = 7\n\n\n3\n5\n7 + 5 = 12\n\n\n4\n6\n12 + 6 = 18\n\n\n5\n3\n18 + 3 = 21\n\n\n6\n7\n21 + 7 = 28\n\n\n\nIn the first iteration of the for-loop (i = 0), we have the initial number 0 for total_sum so adding a[0] results in a new value of total_sum being 0 + 1 = 1.\nIn the second iteration, with now total_sum equal to 1, we add the number a[1], which results in the new value of total_sum being 1 (current number of total_sum) plus a[1] (which is 4), resulting in a new running total of 1 + 4 = 5.\nIf we would be interested in only computing the sum of the first three numbers in a, we could replace the index list [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] by [0,1,2].\n\na = [1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 3, 7]\ntotal_sum = 0\n\nfor i in [0,1,2]:\n    total_sum = total_sum + a[i]\n\ntotal_sum\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.4\n\n\n\nCreate the list a = [1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 3, 7].\n\nCompute the sum of the numbers at the even indices using a for-loop.\nCompute the product of the numbers in a using a for-loop.\n\n\n\nIf you want to execute more lines of code in every iteration of the for-loop, you should indent all of them. In the code below we compute the running total total_sum and also use the print() command of Python to print the value of the running total after every addition. This results in all the values in the right column of the above table being printed.\n\na = [1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 3, 7]\ntotal_sum = 0\n\nfor i in [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]:\n    total_sum = total_sum + a[i]\n    print(total_sum)\n\n1\n5\n7\n12\n18\n21\n28",

    "text": "3.5 Conditional statements\nIn many programming situations, we want the computer to make decisions based on certain conditions. For example, if a number is negative, we might want to handle it differently than if it were positive. In Python, we can do this using conditional statements, also known as if/else statements.\nLet’s look at a basic example:\n\nx = 5\n\nif x &gt; 0:\n    print(\"x is positive\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is not positive\")\n\nx is positive\n\n\nHere is what this code does:\n\nx = 5 assigns the number 5 to the variable x.\nif x &gt; 0: checks whether x is greater than zero, i.e, it check the condition x &gt; 0. If the condition is true, it executes the indented block underneath: In this case we use the print() command of Python to print a piece of text (which can be done by putting it in quotations).\nIf the condition is not true (i.e., x \\leq 0), then Python executes the indented code under else:.\n\nWe can also have multiple conditions using elif, which stands for “else if”:\n\nx = 0\n\nif x &gt; 0:\n    print(\"x is positive\")\nelif x == 0:\n    print(\"x is zero\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is negative\")\n\nx is zero\n\n\nThis checks the conditions one by one from top to bottom and executes the first indented code block where the condition is true. If you want more than three conditions, you should start with an if statement, then elif statements, and finish with an else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.5\n\n\n\nCreate the list a = [1, 4, -4, 0, 5, -3, -7] in Python.\nUse a for-loop in combination with the code above to check for every number in a whether it is positive, zero, or negative. If a number is positive you should print the message \"The number is positive\", if it is zero \"The number is zero\" and if it is negative \"The number is negative\".\nThe output of your piece of code should be as follows.\n\n\nThe number is positive\nThe number is positive\nThe number is negative\nThe number is zero\nThe number is positive\nThe number is negative\nThe number is negative\n\n\n\n\nLet us now look at an example from mathematics. Suppose we want to compute the roots x of a quadratic equation of the form: \nax^2 + bx + c = 0\n Here a,b and c are known given number, and the goal is to find one or more x’s that satisfy the above equation.\nFrom high school math (“Wiskunde B”), we know that the solutions are given by the “abc-formula”: \nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n and that the expression under the square root, called the discriminant, determines how many (real) roots exist:\n\nIf b^2 - 4ac &gt; 0, the equation has two real roots.\nIf b^2 - 4ac = 0, the equation has exactly one real root.\nIf b^2 - 4ac &lt; 0, there are no real roots (in the real number system).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.6\n\n\n\nCreate variables a = 3, b = 2 and c = -1. Create a variable D for the discriminant (in terms of a,b and c).\n\nUse conditional statements to determine how many roots the quadratic formula ax^2 + bx + c has, based on the three possibilities for the discriminant. For each possibility, print an appropriate message in the indented code block. For the chosen a,b and c, the function has two roots (so this case should be printed in your code). \nUse conditional statements to print the roots x of the quadratic formula ax^2 + bx + c, based on the three possibilities for the discriminant (in the third case, do not print the roots, but a message saying there are no roots). Hint: If you want to print two variables y and z you can use print(x,y) or use print(x) and print(y) on different indented lines.  For the chosen a,b and c, your output should show the roots -0.9106 and 0.244 (possibly with more or less decimals).\n\n\nYou can play around with your code by choosing different numbers for a,b and c, and see if you get different output cases for both questions above.",

Say we want to know the values of f(-3), f(-2.5), f(1) and f(4). What we would like to do is to ‘automate’ the computation of a function value, so we do not have to repeat this everytime.\nFor this we can use a Python function for this as follows.\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 + 2*x - 1\nWhat does the code above do? First of all the syntax to tell Python we want to define a function called f that takes as input a number x is def f(x):.\nWe next have to tell Python what the function is supposed to compute. On the second line, with one tab indented, we have the return statement. Here we write down the expression that the function should compute, which in our case is the function value f(x) = x^2 + 2x^2 -1.\nWe can now compute the function value f(x) for any value of x. What happens is that Python calls the function f with input the chosen value of x, and then returns the function value f(x), i.e., the expression in the return statement.\nf(-3)\n\n2\nf(1)\n\n2\nNote that you can also name the function differently, for example we could also have done def quadratic_function(x):. The important thing is that the name of the function should be the same as the name you use in the command to compute a function value.\ndef quadratic_function(x):\n    return x**2 + 2*x - 1\n    \nquadratic_function(1)\n\n2\nJust as your graphing calculator we can plot a Python function, search for its roots, integrate a certain area under the curve and much more! More advanced tasks that Python can handle will introduced in later courses in the curriculum.\nIf you want to get a better understanding of the codes in the coming sections, you could already have a look at Chapter 9 of this course document of another course taught at the Tilburg School of Economics and Management.

    "text": "4.3 Root finding\nSimilarly, the SciPy package can be used to carry out various mathematical tasks and algorithms, making it very important for data analysis purposes.\nThe code below uses a pre-written Python function called fsolve() from SciPy to compute the roots of a function f. In other words, fsolve() is a mathematical algorithm for finding the root of a function, such as Newton’s method, that someone implemented in Python and made available publicly for the whole world to use. If you are interested in the source code of this function, you can look it up in the documentation of Python (more specifically, SciPy in this case).\n\nimport scipy.optimize as optimize\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2 + 2*x - 1\n\nguess = 3\nf_zero = optimize.fsolve(f,guess) \n\nprint(\"A root of the function f is given by\", f_zero)\n\nA root of the function f is given by [0.41421356]\n\n\nThe function fsolve() takes two inputs: a function of which we want to find a root, and an initial guess (3 in our case) of where the root is.\nEntering an initial guess for where the root is located, is in some sense the equivalent of giving a bracket in which the root should lie on your graphing calculator. In fact, there are other root finding functions available in Python that work in this way, i.e., that require you to give an initial bracket, just as you do on your graphing calculator.\nDifferent initial guesses might lead to different roots found by Python. In fact, as you can see the function f has two roots of which the above code finds the right one. We could find the left root by filling in a different initial guess, e.g., -3 instead of 3.\n\nguess = -3\nf_zero = optimize.fsolve(f,guess) \n\nprint(\"A root of the function f is given by\", f_zero)\n\nA root of the function f is given by [-2.41421356]",
