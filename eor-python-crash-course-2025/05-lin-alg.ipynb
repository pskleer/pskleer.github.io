    "In this chapter we will learn how to use Python for linear algebra. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first session of this crash course you have learned the basics of Python: how to use Python as a calculator, use lists, for-loops, and if-else-statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be used for much more advanced operations as well. As you can imagine, code quickly grows more complicated. Fortunately, we can reuse code written by other through so-called **packages** (or libraries). In the optional chapter @sec-math-basics you might have seen several packages already. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using packages has several advantages. If you use a standard package, then it makes your code more readable. It also reduces the risk of errors: Python packages are typically developed by expert programmers and thoroughly tested before they are released to the public. For the mainstream packages that we will be using, you can thus be reasonably confident that they deliver what they promise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another major advantage of packages is that they are often heavily optimized in terms of speed and memory efficiency.^[Under the hood, numpy for instance relies on BLAS and LAPACK for most of its linear algebraic subroutines. BLAS and LAPACK are written in a programming language called Fortran, see for example the <a href =\"https://www.netlib.org/lapack/#_presentation\">LAPACK documentation</a>. LAPACK is used by many other programming languages, including Matlab.] \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will use several well-known packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <a href=\"https://numpy.org/\">NumPy</a>, \n",
    "- Sympy, \n",
    "- and <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/\">Matplotlib</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell: packages are functions written by other people to make our life easy, i.e., so that we do not have to write every code file from scratch in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The NumPy, SymPy and Matplotlib packages should be installed in a standard Anaconda installation. If you have another Python installation, typically using the PIP package manager should allow you to install packages. In this case, commands like `pip install numpy` and `pip install sympy` should do the job.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why `numpy` and `sympy`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The package `numpy` is designed for fast numerical calculations, e.g., with matrices. We can compute matrix products, solve linear systems, and compute inverses with `numpy` very quicky.\n",
    "The package `sympy`, on the other hand, is a symbolic mathematics library. It can do exact algebraic manipulations (also with variables x and y), but it is less quick than numerical computations with `numpy`. `sympy` also contains a method to do exact row-reduction, to bring a matrix into reduced echelon form. This may also be useful if you did row-reduction by hand and want to verify your result with the computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic matrix and vector operations with Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have the following vectors $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$, and matrix $A$: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\2\\\\3 \\end{array} \\right], \\mathbf{y}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}4\\\\5\\\\7 \\end{array} \\right],  A =  \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 8 & 9 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
